              <p>Hi! My name is Claude Johnson and I've been passionately playing guitar for 25 years. </p>
              <p>I've yet to find something more gratifying and fulfilling than playing guitar except for... TEACHING guitar to someone else.</p>
              <p>I love seeing students, young and old, light up with delight as they learn how to play their favorite songs.</p>
              <p>It's exhilarating to see a guitar student "rock out"... or learn how to write their own songs on the acoustic... or... learn the groovy basics of jazz and blues.</p>
              <p>Today I'm gonna share with you the 5 critical factors you need to know before you even THINK of hiring any guitar teacher:</p>

                <div class="freelesLeft">Critical Factor #1:</div>
                <div class="freelesRight">
                  <h1>Passion</h1>
                  <p>Passion... excitement... inspiration... They are the most important qualities for any great guitar teacher.</p>
                  <p>The last thing you want is a teacher who’s an unenthusiastic guy "just going through the motions".</p>
                  <p>When someone loves what they’re doing, it comes through in the guitar lessons... the details... the inspiration... and the results.</p>
                  <p>The inspiration fuels the students progress to new heights in record time.</p>

                <div class="freelesLeft">Critical Factor #2:</div>
                <div class="freelesRight">
                  <h1>Experience</h1>
                  <p>Learning an instrument is a lifelong journey.  Lessons are  great because you get to benefit from someone who's "Been there, done that".  You want to take advantage of their wisdom and experience.</p>
                  <p>You can save yourself years of pain and suffering by learning the "shortcuts" to guitar mastery.</p>
                  <p>A great guitar teacher is a perpetual student who's always learning something new and exciting so he can share with his students.</p>

              <div class="freeLes freeLes03"><!-- start freeLes03 -->
                <div class="freelesLeft">Critical Factor #3:</div>
                <div class="freelesRight">
                  <h1>A POWERFUL SEQUENTIAL SYSTEM</h1>
                  <p>Too many guitar teachers teach whatever they "feel like" that day and throw together a mish-mash of random guitar lessons.</p>
                  <p>The worst part is -- it leaves the student feeling confused and frustrated.</p>
                  <p>And there's nothing more sad than seeing a student quit because they had a bad teacher. Every great guitar teacher uses a sequential, step-by-step guitar system designed to maximize your progress.</p>
                  <p>I actually have SEVERAL different systems that I use for different styles and students. These systems took years (even decades) to build and I’m going to hand them to you on a silver platter.</p>

                  <h1>ACCELERATED LEARNING TECHNOLOGY</h1>
                  <p>Can you increase speed of your learning by dialing in the perfect "learning modality" for YOU?</p>
                  <p>There are 4 ways someone can learn: visual, aural, analytical, and kinesthetic. Most people are a combination of these, but have 1 or 2 dominant learning styles.</p>
